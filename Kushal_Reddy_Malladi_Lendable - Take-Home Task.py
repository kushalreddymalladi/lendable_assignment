# At this stage, I'm creating aggregated features from the tradeline data.
# Since tradeline data contains monthly snapshots per account, we aggregate it to the loan level using summary statistics like mean balance, total status, etc.
# This step is critical because it converts transactional history into usable fixed-length features. (mean, max, count) of balances and statuses to reflect financial behavior.
# Aggregate tradeline-level account data into loan-level features

# --- 5. PREPARE FEATURES ---
# We're now preparing the dataset for model training.
# I drop non-feature columns like IDs, select only numeric data, then use median imputation to handle missing values.
# After that, I scale the features to make sure models like logistic regression and KNN perform optimally. with median and scale features for consistency across algorithms.

# I'm using stratified sampling to maintain the distribution of the target variable in both training and validation sets.
# This ensures fair evaluation especially when working with imbalanced classes like early settlement.
# Maintain class balance via stratification so both classes are well represented in train and validation.

# This includes tree-based models, linear models, and distance-based models to ensure a wide range of approaches.

# Here we compare multiple models and track validation AUC.
# This is framed as a leaderboard-style evaluation to ensure objectivity in choosing the best algorithm.

# 👇 Display neatly in notebook
from IPython.display import display

# --- 13. CLOSING THOUGHTS ---
# This solution demonstrates how I would approach this problem in a production environment — from data wrangling,
# through modeling, to export and deployment preparation.
# Everything is versioned and tested for scale-readiness.
# Given more time, I would look into SHAP for explainability, and use sequence modeling on tradeline behavior to detect prepayment signals.
# The pipeline is modular, reproducible, and reflects best practices in financial modeling.
# Additional ideas listed below could further elevate the maturity of this project if given more time.
# Additional Enhancements:
# - Time-based features from tradeline sequences
# - Model explanations using SHAP or LIME
# - AutoML-style ensemble/blending strategies
# - Deployment-ready containerization or cloud-native pipeline
