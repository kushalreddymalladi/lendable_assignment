##How to Run the API (Locally with Docker)

(https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is installed and running.

1. **Build the Docker image**:

```bash
docker build -t lendable-api .

2. **Run the container**:

docker run -p 8000:8000 lendable-api

3. Access the API documentation:

open browser and goto:
http://localhost:8000/docs

4. API Endpoint
GET / â†’ Health check
Response: { "message": "API is working!" }

5. Model Training Notebook

The notebook performs:
Feature preprocessing and encoding
Handling missing data with SimpleImputer
Scaling with StandardScaler
Model training (e.g., XGBoost)
Exporting predictions to CSV

6. Dependencies
pip install -r requiremnts.txt
